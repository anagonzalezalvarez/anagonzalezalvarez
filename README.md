  ðŸ‘‹&nbsp; Hi there!
</p>

<p>
  
I am a bioinformatician interested in using computational tools to understand how the brain develops and processes sensory information. My current work focuses on integrating short-read and long-read RNA sequencing data to analyze gene expression and splicing changes in specific cell types during development.
